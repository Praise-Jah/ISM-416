    "1 Ambiguity: Natural language is very ambiguous. Therefore, the computer might might mistake an input for another thing or mistake the meaning of an input for another meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "2 Data challenges: The main challenge is information overload, which poses a big problem to access a specific and important piece of information from vast datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 The next challenge is the extraction of the relevant and correct information from unstructured or semi-structured data using Information Extraction (IE) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Context and intent are also potential NLP challenges. Much of day-to-day speech relies heavily on contextual words and phrases, which are much harder for a machine to understand.\n",
